### Theory

A loop is a control structure used to execute a set of statements repeatedly. In Python, the for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance. It is commonly used with the range() function to generate a sequence of numbers.

Nested loops are loops placed inside another loop. They are mainly used in matrix operations and pattern printing. Matrix multiplication requires three nested loops to perform row and column operations.

In this experiment, various programs were implemented to understand iteration, matrix traversal, prime number logic and pattern printing using for loops.

#### Functions Used

• range() – Used to generate sequence of numbers.

• input() – Used to accept input from the user.

---

#### Operators and Statements Used

• For loop – Used for iteration.

• Nested loop – Used for matrix and pattern operations.

• Relational operators – Used for prime number checking.

• Arithmetic operators – Used for calculations.

• break statement – Used to terminate loop when condition is satisfied.
